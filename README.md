# ExquisiteCorpse
In the game Exquisite Corpse, participants draw either a head, body, or feet of a creature. The players donâ€™t know how their part of the body connects to the other two, until the drawing is finished and revealed. This app mimics the game using methods to randomly combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature.
